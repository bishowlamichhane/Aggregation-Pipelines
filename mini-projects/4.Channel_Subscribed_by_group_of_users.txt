4. Channels Subscribed to by a Group of Users

Description: This project finds common channels subscribed to by a specific group of users. It aggregates subscription data to identify channels subscribed to by multiple users. How it was made:

We used $match to filter subscriptions for a list of specific users.
$group was used to group the subscriptions by channel and count how many users subscribed to each one.
$match was then used to filter out channels subscribed to by fewer than 2 users.




---> controller Code

    const commonSubscriptions = await Subscription.aggregate([
        {
          $match: { subscriber: { $in: [userId1, userId2, userId3] } }  // Match subscriptions for specific users
        },
        {
          $group: {
            _id: "$channel",  // Group by channel
            count: { $sum: 1 }  // Count how many users subscribed to each channel
          }
        },
        {
          $match: { count: { $gte: 2 } }  // Filter channels subscribed to by at least 2 users
        }
      ]);
      
      console.log(commonSubscriptions);
